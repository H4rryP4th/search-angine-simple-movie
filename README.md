# Search-Engine-Simple-Movie
i try to make apps like website simple search movie engine with API from <http://www.omdbapi.com/>, i only use technology general like HTML, CSS(Inline), JavaScript, Bootstrap(Framework HTML & CSS) for User Interface(UI)

## Flow
1. The first time i create file normal HTML in the file i use Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network), my Bootstrap version 5.0.2, i only use file CDN like *bootstrap.min.css* for easy when i get or use this file because this file have delete character "not important" like character space " "
2. After i create UI design, next i open <http://www.omdbapi.com/> for get key private API connect my website, but after get we register that website with "status" free
3. And then i do Http Request with technology JavaScript, i do get the request to server i use *XMLHttpRequest() / AJAX*, when i use it by continue i benchmark for get API movie
4. I prepare for prevent when server "down" cannot get API, program run when status server "200" only, that's safety right ??
5. For view this API i use feature JavaScript "Looping" element HTML i combination with Bootstrap for Layout can run on every device
6. Homepage, i put feature search movie, any movie in this search not sensitive for searching movie, when you search movie have relation with you keyword so program can search all movie, that's page you can not see description movie
7. Single page have description or detail product movie, that is sensitive searching, you must input "keyword" precision
8. Next about page and contact us like name page, i have only out dummy data for example page.
